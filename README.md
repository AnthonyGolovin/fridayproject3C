## Description/Specs

_spec: The program gives the user the ability to add vendors and orders to those vendors.

EX: User will see the following:
1."Add new vendor, see all current vendors"
2. Clicking the "Add new vendor" will lead the user to a new page that will ask the user to input "Vendor Name".
3. From there the user can input the name and it will appear in the vendors tab.
4. Clicking on a vendor will show information on the vendor as well as providing a buton labeled "Add an order".
5. Clicking on that button will lead the user to the order creating page which asks for four inputs (Title, description, price, date).
6. Filling in those inputs and submitting will add that order to the vendor._
